1. Write a function that receives a pointer to a two-dimensional dynamic array
(a pointer to the first member of an array of pointers) and numbers two rows of the array.
The function must realize the replacement of the contents of the given rows in the array in O(1) time.
The function must be universal towards the type of array members.

2. Write a function that receives a pointer to a two-dimensional dynamic array, 
the number of rows in the array and the numbers of two columns of the array.
The function must implement the replacement of the contents of the given columns in the array.

Write a program that is given an array of pointers to integers.
The program must construct a matrix as a 2D dynamic array based on 
the given array of pointers and fill the matrix arbitrarily.
Activate the row swap and column swap functions for the matrix above.
The matrix must be printed after its creation, 
after calling the first function and after calling the second function.

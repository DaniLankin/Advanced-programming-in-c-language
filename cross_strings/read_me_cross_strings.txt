Write a function that accepts two strings and returns the number of words in the first string 
that also exist in the second string. If the second string contains words that repeat themselves, 
the function will refer only to the first occurrence of the word. 
For example, for the following strings:


1.str1: "set your goals and achieve them if you are good enough".
2.str2: â€œeach course has a set of goals to achieve and a set of tools to use.


The function will return 4 because the following words that appear in the first string also appear in the second string:
 "set", "goals", "and", "achieve".
Please note: the fact that the word "set" appears twice in the second string does not affect the result.

Note 1: It can be assumed that the strings have only lowercase letters and each word is separated from another word by one space.
Note 2: It is allowed and even recommended to use auxiliary functions as needed.
Note 3: It can be assumed that a word is not repeated more than once in the first string.
